# Running

## Docker

This project can be setup on any platform through the use of Docker containers. A docker file can be found in the root of the repository, information on how to get setup and running with can be found in [Docker_README.md](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-translator/blob/master/Docker_README.md)

## Dependencies

Ensure you have HeaderDoc installed:

- Under macOS, you will need to have Xcode with Developer Tools installed.
- Under Ubuntu, you can download HeaderDoc at Apple's OpenSource Developer Tools
  [here](https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/headerdoc/).

Install dependencies using `bundle`:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Then run using `translate`.

## Validating

To validate a single file or files, supply the `--validate` or `-v` switch and
the `--input` or `-i` switch with the header file you wish to validate:

```bash
$ ./translate --validate --input /path/to/splashkit/coresdk/src/coresdk/audio.h
```

This will only _validate_ input that it can be correctly parsed, but will not
generate any translated code.

Alternatively, you can validate all header files by supplying just the
SplashKit `coresdk/src/coresdk` directory instead:

```bash
$ ./translate -v -i /path/to/splashkit/coresdk/src/coresdk
```

## Converting

To convert, follow the same as the above, removing the `--validate`/`-v` switch
and supplying the translated language you would like to generate using a
comma-separated list under the `--generate` or `-g` switch and specifying the
output directory using the `--output` or `-o` switch:

```bash
$ ./translate -i /path/to/splashkit -o ~/Desktop/translated -g YAML,SKLIBC,CPP
```

If no output directory is used, then it will default to an `out/translated`
directory inside the input directory specified.

To see a full list of each translator available, use the `--help` switch.

# SplashKit Documentation Guidelines

SplashKit uses [HeaderDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeaderDoc) to parse
documentation. A guide on HeaderDoc can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/HeaderDoc/intro/intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001215-CH345-SW1).

**Ensure that `snake_case` is consistently used throughout documentation.**

## Header File Docblocks

A header file should begin with a docblock consisting of:

1. `@header [name]` - The name of the 'module' of functions and types defined in
   the header. E.g., `audio.h` would be listed as `Audio`.
2. `@author [name]` - One or many author names who have contributed to the
   header and/or implementation
3. `@brief [description]` - A brief, one sentence description of what
   functionality is added in this 'module'.
4. A longer description of the functionality. The description accepts Markdown.
5. `@attribute group [group]` - Groups the contents of the file under a specific
   group name. Refer to [group](#group) for more.

Example, `audio.h`:

```c
/**
 * @header Audio
 * @author Andrew Cain
 * @brief SplashKit Audio allows you to load and play music and sound effects.
 *
 * The SplashKit's audio library allows you to easily load and play music and
 * sound effects within your programs. To get started with audio the first
 * thing you need to do is load a sound effect or music file. You can do this
 * by calling the `load_sound_effect(string name)` function to the
 * `load_music(string name)` function.
 *
 * @attribute static audio
 */
```

Any attributes set in a header file docblock will apply those attributes to all
docblocks inside that file. In the example above, all docblocks will have
`@attribute static audio` added to them _unless_ `@attribute static` is already
listed in a docblock.

## Function Docblocks

A function docblock should consist of _at least_ a basic description of the
functionality provided by the function in Markdown. Where applicable, it also
must have:

* `@param [name] [description]` - The name and description of a parameter.
  These should be listed in order of the function's signature. **All parameters
  must be listed and be consistent with the correct name(s) in the signature.**
* `@returns [description]` - A basic description of what is returned from the
  function. **Any non-void function must have an `@returns`**.
* `@brief [description]` - A brief, one sentence description of what
  functionality is added in this function.

Each of the above should be separated with a newline and grouped together where
applicable.

Example, `load_sound_effect`:
```c
/**
 * @brief Loads and returns a sound effect.
 *
 * The supplied `filename` is used to locate the sound effect to load. The
 * supplied `name` indicates the name to use to refer to this `sound_effect`.
 * The `sound_effect` can then be retrieved by passing this `name` to
 * the `sound_effect_named` function.
 *
 * @param name      The name used to refer to the sound effect.
 * @param filename  The filename used to locate the sound effect to use.
 *
 * @returns A new `sound_effect` with the initialised values provided.
 */
sound_effect load_sound_effect(string name, string filename);
```

## Enum Docblocks

An enum docblock **must** define every one of its constants using the
`@constant` tag. For example:

```c
/**
 * Defines each of the five weekdays
 *
 * @constant Monday     The day where you want to go sleep
 * @constant Tuesday    The day where you start to get stuff done
 * @constant Wednesday  The day where you realise you're only midway through
 * @constant Thursday   The day where you can smell Friday coming
 * @constant Friday     The day where you party hard
 */
enum weekdays {
  Monday,
  Tuesday,
  Wednesday,
  Thursday,
  Friday
};
```

## Struct Docblocks

A struct docblock must define each of its field members using a `@param` tag.
For example:

```c
/**
 * Defines basic details for a person
 *
 * @param name    The name of the person
 * @param age     The age of the person
 * @param friend  The person's bestest friend in the whole world
 */
struct person {
  string name,
  int age,
  person *friend
};
```

## Typedef Docblocks

A function docblock should consist of _at least_ a basic description of the
functionality provided by the function in Markdown.

## Attributes

Attributes provide options to the language translator. They are applicable to
functions and typedef docblocks. Attributes are declared as thus:

```c
/**
 * @attribute [key] [value]
 */
```

Here is a list of all accepted attribute keys:

### `class`

#### Usage in typedefs

When added to a typedef, the type will be declared as a class:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class sound_effect
 */
typedef struct _sound_data *sound_effect;
```

<a id="pr16-class"></a>
Note that typedef aliases to pointers **must** be declared with a `class` attribute.

#### Usage in functions

Associates the `sound_effect` type to an object-oriented-translated SplashKit
class _instance_.

When added to a function, the type will be associated to a class. You must
pair this with `method`, `constructor`, `destructor`, `getter`, or `setter`
attribute (see below) to define how the function will be associated to under
that class.

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class  audio
 * @attribute method close
 */
void close_audio();
```

This will convert the above to an equivalent OO method:

```c
Audio.Close()
```

### `static`

Indicates the module or class name to which a global method or function is
applied. Can be associated to a `method` name to create a static method on a
class or global function on a method, or a static `getter` or `setter`.

Refer to `method` for more.

### `method`

Associates a function to a class. Requires the `class` or `static` attribute to
be set. The name specified by `method` will be the method name that will be used
as the method on the class. See the above example.

<a id="pr2-instance-method"></a>
When `method` is used with the `class` attribute, an _instance method_ will be
generated on the class whose name is specified by `class`.

<a id="pr2-static-method"></a>
When `method` is used with the `static` attribute, a _static method_ will be
generated on the class whose name is specified by `static`.

### `constructor`

Associates a function as the constructor to a class.

<a id="pr1-constructor"></a>
Requires the `class` attribute to be set in order to construct an _instance_
of that class.

To mark a constructor, simply set the value as `true`:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class       sound_effect
 * @attribute constructor true
 */
sound_effect load_sound_effect(string name, string filename);
```

This will convert the above to an equivalent OO constructor:

```c
SoundEffect(string name, string filename)
```

<a id="pr3-constructor"></a>
If defining a `constructor`, then you cannot violate this attribute with a
`destructor` attribute in the same HeaderDoc block.

<a id="pr4-constructor"></a>
<a id="pr5-destructor"></a>
Unless `static` is specified, then a `destructor` function cannot _also_ act as
a instance `getter`, `setter` or `method`.

### `destructor`

Same as `constructor`, but for a destructor.

<a id="pr1-destructor"></a>
Requires the `class` attribute to be set in order to destruct an _instance_
of that class.

Similarly, to destruct a particular instance, the instance object will be
passed into the parameter specified by a `self` attribute. Thus `self` must
be set on `destructor`s.

For example:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class       sound_effect
 * @attribute self        effect
 * @attribute destructor  true
 */
void delete_sound_effect(sound_effect effect);
```

This would call the `delete_sound_effect` on the instance, where the instance is
the `effect` parameter:

```cpp
delete someSoundEffectInstance;
```

<a id="pr3-destructor"></a>
If defining a `destructor`, then you cannot violate this attribute with a
`constructor` attribute in the same HeaderDoc block.

<a id="pr4-destructor"></a>
<a id="pr5-destructor"></a>
Unless `static` is specified, then a `destructor` function cannot _also_ act as
an instance `getter`, `setter` or `method`.

### `self`

Specifies the name of the parameter which should act as `this` or `self` on the
function call.

<a id="pr1-self"></a>
When the function is converted to a method for an object-oriented language,
the instance calling the method will be passed into parameter specified by
`self`.

<a id="pr7-self"></a>
<a id="pr8-self"></a>
To know which type the `self` parameter would be, list the `class` of that
parameter and make sure it matches the name of the parameter indicated by
`self`.

For example:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class   sound_effect
 * @attribute method  play
 * @attribute self    effect
 */
void play_sound_effect(sound_effect effect, int times, float volume);
```

When translated into OO:

```cpp
someSoundEffectInstance.play(3, 10.0f)
```

will call

```c
play_sound_effect(someSoundEffectInstance, 3, 10.0f)
```

When using a `self` attribute, you must ensure that **the parameter named by
`self` has a type which matches the `class` attribute value**. For example, the
following will cause an error since `times` is an `int`, which does not match
the `class` attribute value of type `sound_effect`:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class   sound_effect    <-------------------------------
 * @attribute method  play                                             \
 * @attribute self    times           <--- times is an int, not a sound_effect!!
 */
void play_sound_effect(sound_effect effect, int times, float volume);
```

### `suffix`

For translated languages that do not support overloaded function names, the
name specified by `suffix` name will be used as a suffix appended to the global
and instance name of the function.

<a id="pr15-suffix"></a>
If `class` is specified, then the `method` name appended with `suffix` must be
unique _within that `class`_.

If `static` is specified, then function name appended with `suffix` must be
unique _within that `static` namespace_.

<a id="pr14-suffix"></a>
If neither are specified, then function name appended with `suffix` must be
unique _globally_.

For example:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute static  audio
 * @attribute class   sound_effect
 * @attribute method  play
 * @attribute suffix  with_loops_and_volume
 * @attribute self    effect
 */
void play_sound_effect(sound_effect effect, int times, float volume);
```

will be translated into Python as:

```python
some_sound_effect_instance.play_with_loops_and_volume(3, 10.0)
play_sound_effect_with_loops_and_volume(effect, 3, 10.0)
```

whereas in C# it would look like:

```c#
someSoundEffectInstance.play(3, 10.0f)
Audio.PlaySoundEffect(effect, 3, 10.0f)
```

### `getter`

Creates a getter method to the `class` or `static` module specified. Requires
either:

<a id="pr2-instance-getter"></a>
<a id="pr4-instance-getter"></a>
<a id="pr2-static-getter"></a>

* `class` and `self` to make an _instance_ getter on the an instance whose class
   is specified by `class`, or
* `static` to make a _static_ getter on the class specified `static`.

Must be set on a function that:

<a id="pr9-getter"></a>

* has __exactly__ _zero_ or _one_ parameters, depending on if you are using
  `class` or `static`, and
* is non-void.

<a id="pr12-getter"></a>
If you are writing a __`static`__ getter, then there must be no parameters.

<a id="pr6-getter"></a>
<a id="pr10-getter"></a>
If you are writing a __`class`__ setter, then you will need __exactly _one_
parameter__, that being the parameter which will be used as `self`. You must
not specify that the function also a `method` (unless `static` is also supplied)
or a `constructor` or `destructor`.

For example, the following:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute static  audio
 * @attribute getter  is_open
 */
bool audio_is_open();

/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class   query_result
 * @attribute self    effect
 * @attribyte getter  is_empty
 */
bool query_result_empty(query_result result);
```

generates usage for the following in C#:

```c#
if (Audio.IsOpen) { ... }
if (myDatabase.queryResult.IsEmpty) { ... };
```

### `setter`

Creates a setter method on the `class` instance of `static` module. Requires
either:

<a id="pr2-instance-setter"></a>
<a id="pr4-instance-setter"></a>
<a id="pr2-static-setter"></a>

* `class` and `self` to make an _instance_ setter on the an instance whose class
   is specified by `class`, or
* `static` to make a _static_ setter on the class specified `static`.


Must be set on a function that has __exactly__ _one_ or _two_ parameters, which
depends on if you are using `class` or `static`.

<a id="pr13-setter"></a>
If you are writing a __`static`__ setter, then you will need __exactly one
parameter__, being the the second must the value that is to be set.

<a id="pr11-setter"></a>
If you are writing a __`class`__ setter, then you will need __exactly _two_
parameters__, where:

1. the first must be the the parameter which will be used as `self`, and
2. the second must the value that is to be set.

<a id="pr6-setter"></a>
You must not specify that this is also a `method` (unless `static` is also
supplied) or a `constructor` or `destructor`.

For example, the following:

```c
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute static  audio
 * @attribute setter  is_open
 */
void audio_status(bool open);

/**
 * ...
 *
 * @attribute class   database
 * @attribute self    db
 * @attribyte setter  last_query
 */
void database_set_query_result(database db, query_result result);
```

generates usage for the following in C#:

```c#
Audio.IsOpen = false;
myDatabase.LastQuery = myQueryResult;
```

### `group`

Applicable only to header file HeaderDoc blocks. The value associated to group
means that this particular header file is `group`ed under the group specified
by this attribute. Related header files may be applicable to just the one, e.g.:

* `audio.h`,
* `sound_effect.h`, and
* `music.h`

could all be `group`ed under the `Audio` group.

### `note`

Use this to add an arbitrary note to any HeaderDoc block.

**It is important to place the contents of your note on a new line.**

#### Unknown attribute issue

Not placing your content of your note over two lines will cause issues. Refer
to the example below:

```c
/**
 * @attribute note This is a really cool function
 *   that goes over two lines woohoo!
 */
int my_func();
```

The above will cause the following parser issue:

```
Unknown attribute keys are present: `note This is a really cool function`.
```

To fix this, you change the example to:

```c
/**
 * @attribute note
 *   This is a really cool function
 *   that goes over two lines woohoo!
 */
int my_func();
```

Unfortunately, multi-line markdown parsing will not work, such as lists, code
blocks and multiple paragraphs.

## Summary of Parser Rules

If any of these basic rules are violated, then the parser will throw a fatal
error and stop parsing along with its respective parser rule (PR) number
for reference to this list.

1. <a id="rule-1"></a>
   Attributes marked with [`self`](#pr1-self), [`destructor`](#pr1-destructor)
   [`constructor`](#pr1-constructor) must have a `class` attribute specified.
2. <a id="rule-2"></a>
   Attributes marked with `method`, `getter` or `setter` must be marked with
   either:

    (i) **`class`** to make it an [instance method](#pr2-instance-method), [instance getter](#pr2-instance-getter) or [instance setter](#pr2-instance-setter) on _instance_ of that class, or

    (ii) **`static`** to make it a [static method](#pr2-static-method), [static getter](#pr2-static-getter) or [static setter](#pr2-static-setter) on a class or module indicated by static.

3. <a id="rule-3"></a>
   There can never be both [`constructor`](#pr3-constructor) and
   [`destructor`](#pr3-destructor) attributes marked together in the same
   HeaderDoc block.
4. <a id="rule-4"></a>
   If you do not supply `static`, then you cannot have a
   [`constructor`](#pr4-constructor) or [`destructor`](#pr4-destructor) with
   a `getter` or `setter` in the same block. This would imply that there is an
   [instance getter](#pr4-instance-getter) or
   [instance setter](#pr4-instance-setter) along with a constructor or
   destructor of that instance by the _one_ function.
5. <a id="rule-5"></a>
   You cannot supply [`constructor`](#pr5-constructor) or
   [`destructor`](#pr5-destructor)  and `method` unless
   `static` is also supplied. This will make a static method on
   the class or module specified by static but a destructor/constructor on
   the class indicated by `class`.
6. <a id="rule-6"></a>
   Same as above, except for [`getter`](#pr6-getter)s and
   [`setter`](#pr6-setter)s.
7. <a id="rule-7"></a>
   A `self` attribute [should always have a value that matches the name of a
   parameter](#pr7-self) in the function.
8. <a id="rule-8"></a>
   When `self` is specified, then the parameter name it specifies
   should [have the same type as the `class` specified](#pr8-self).
9. <a id="rule-9"></a>
   [A `getter` should always return something](#pr9-getter), and must not return
   `void` unless it is `void*`.
10. <a id="rule-10"></a>
    [When `class` is specified with a `getter`, there should
    always be one parameter](#pr10-getter) (the parameter for `self`).
11. <a id="rule-11"></a>
    [When `class` is specified with a `setter`, there should
    always be two parameters](#pr11-setter):

    (i) the parameter for `self`, and

    (ii) the value to set.

12. <a id="rule-12"></a>
    [When `static` is specified with a `getter`, there should always be no
    parameters](#pr12-getter).
13. <a id="rule-13"></a>
    [When `static` is specified with a `setter`, there should always be one
    parameter](#pr13-setter). That is, the value to set.
14. <a id="rule-14"></a>
    [When `suffix` is used, the name must be unique to the global
    namespace](#pr14-suffix).
15. <a id="rule-15"></a>
    [When `suffix` is used with a `class` and `method`, the name must be unique
    to the class namespace](#pr15-suffix).
16. <a id="rule-16"></a>
    [When a `class` is used on a type alias, then the type alias must be an
    alias to a pointer](#pr16-class).
